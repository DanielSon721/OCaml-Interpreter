This is my Interpreter made in OCaml!

This interpreter is made to understand a basic language resembling C.

It comes with 3 complete parts:

- A regex-driven lexer recognizing 34 token types
- An parser spanning 17 expression and 8 statement forms
- An evaluator with static type checking

This interpreter comes with 14 operators (5 arithmetic, 6 relational, 3 logical), 3 control-flow constructs (if, while, for), and print functionality!
